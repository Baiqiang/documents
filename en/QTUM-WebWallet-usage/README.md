This is pretty straightforward, we will enter a password which will be used to create a series of of private keys based on the seed words which will be provided by the web wallet.

Please remember to back up these seed words, you and only you as a user have access to these seed words **(Private keys aren't stored on the server, if you lose these seed words you'll lose access to your funds!)**.

Here we're forced to enter the seed words manually to make sure we backed them up

This is our wallet, here we can see:

- Public key
- Balance
- Private key

You can always back up your private key itself, that's where your funds will go and it's very important. Please make sure to use paper backups

## Restore from backup



Restoring from backup is quite simple, however, please make sure to enter your password correctly **(the same one your entered when creating the wallet)** if you enter another password, the wallet will create a new address, so please make sure to enter the correct password.

Here we entered our seed words, and when we click on confirm we're prompted to enter the password, **AGAIN** please make sure to enter the correct password, otherwise the restore won't work.
