it shows the following:\nBalances\n\nAvailable\nPending\nTotal\n\nOther Tokens\nIf we own any tokens, they'll show here, including balance and contract info.\n\nTransactions\nThis shows any transaction that may have taken place, both incoming and outgoing transactions are displayed, this includes staked coins as well.\nBasic wallet functions\nOn the left side of the wallet, we can find basic wallet functionality such as:\n\nSend\nReceive\nSmart Contract\nTransactions (This is a more detailed and full historical set of transactions)\n\nSend Menu\nOn the send menu, we have different functions, all are quite basic to learn and use.\n\nPay to: Here we’ll enter the address we want to send Qtum to (Only Qtum ignition addresses will work).\nLabel:  Optional, as it’s stated, it’s just a name/tag\nAmount: Here we enter the amount of Qtum we want to Send\nOnce all fields are covered, we can click on the “Send” button and the Qtum coins will be sent to the address we entered above.\nReceive\nHere we can display our Qtum wallet address and even generate new ones!\nThis is useful for receiving payments from more than one sender and helps you keep track of each transaction.\n\nTo obtain the deposit address, simply click on “Request Payment” and you’ll see a popup dialog show up with your Qtum wallet deposit address. Here you can receive coins from your exchange or from other users. For this tutorial, we’ll do a test deposit of 54.9 Qtum.\nTransactions\nHere you can see both incoming and outgoing transactions, shows all historical transactions, on the screenshot we have a pending transaction with a few confirmations.\n\nWallet Encryption\nFirst, let’s encrypt this wallet before making the backup, this will allow the backup to be encrypted as well. Go to settings -> Encrypt wallet.\n\nNext, let’s enter the password for this wallet, please remember this password because without it you’ll lose access to your Qtum.\n\nAfter the password is entered and accepted, the wallet will restart and it'll be encrypted.\nWallet Backup\nIt's recommended to make the backup after encrypting the wallet.\n\nTo access the backup option, we go into File/Backup Wallet and then we enter route and name.\nAfter the backup’s name is entered and we’ve verified the route where the wallet is being saved to, we can click on save. Now we’ve successfully backed up our wallet.\nRestore wallet backup\nRecent versions of the QTUM wallet have implemented backup management from the UI. It's a breeze to backup and restore your QTUM wallet!\nGo to File -> Restore wallet, this will open a dialog which will allow us to restore directly from the Qtum-core QT wallet!\n\n\n\nHere we selected the wallet backup with the reindex option selected (salvagewallet can also be used if necessary).\nStaking\nIn order for staking to take place we must:\n\nHave a transaction with more than 500 confirmations on the blockchain\nUnlock our wallet prior to staking (preferably before reaching 500 confirmations on your inputs).\nKeep our wallet open at all times, otherwise even if our coins are matured, they won’t be able to stake.\n\nHere’s how to unlock the wallet for staking only\n\nRemember to have your wallet open 24/7, if you close it, you won’t be able to stake\n\nPlease make sure “for staking only” is selected.\n"},"QTUM-wallet-usage-best-practices/":{"url":"QTUM-wallet-usage-best-practices/","title":"Best Practices","keywords":"","body":"QTUM Wallet Best Practices\nIn this document we'll take a look at how to safely use our QTUM wallet.

Without your password, no one will be able to access your wallet.\nOnce you've backed up and tested your password, make a backup of your wallet.\nTry to keep several copies of your backup in safe locations only, do not use public online services for this, do not trust 3rd party services with your holdings.\n\nLet's review how to:\n\nEncrypt\nBackup wallet\nRestore\n\nWallet Encryption\nFirst, let’s encrypt this wallet before making the backup, this will allow the backup to be encrypted as well.

It can take some minutes before it's fully synced.\nEncrypting wallet\nWe can encrypt the wallet at any time, it's better to do it before we go any further.\nTo do this, type the following on the command line:\nqtum-cli encryptwallet yourpassword\nThis will encrypt the wallet which in turn closes the daemon, you'll see the following message:\nwallet encrypted; Qtum server stopping, restart to run with encrypted wallet. The keypool has been flushed and a new HD seed was generated (if you are using HD). You need to make a new backup.\n\nqtum-cli getaccountaddress \"\" -> Right after launching the daemon, you can obtain your wallet address by typing this.\nYou can send Qtum coins to the address we just obtained from the daemon, please remember that those transactions require at least 500+ confirmations before they become mature enough for staking.\nStaking\nNow that we've waited until we have at least 501 confirmations on our received transaction, we are elligible for staking, however, if our wallet is encrypted (which we did for security reasons) we won't be able to stake, let's open our wallet for staking using the command line!.\nqtum-cli walletpassphrase password 999999999 true\nThe above command will unlock the walet for staking only for 31.6 Years! that should be enough for now. Please note, this will not unlock your backup, only the wallet that's running right now.\nNow that we've unlocked our wallet, we need to wait until we have more than 501 confirmations to be elligible for staking, if we already do, it's a matter of time which will vary depending on the network weight vs your wallet's weight.\nChecking Balance\nTo check your balance, type qtum-cli getinfo this will show general information, including your available balance and balance in staking\nCheck transactions\nTo check your transactions (incoming and outgoing) type qtum-cli listtransactions\nCheck staking info\nTo check Qtum's staking information, type qtum-cli getstakinginfo\nStaking tips\nStaking really depends on network weight vs your wallet’s weight which is based on the amount of coins you have, higher weight increases your chances of staking a block.\nIf you have a large amount of coins, it’s a good idea to split those up in separate transactions, for instance, if you have 10.000 QTUM, it’s better to send 10 transactions of 1000 QTUM each to your wallet, each one generates a UTXO input which will take part in staking. This optimizes the staking process and works much better than just one large 10.000 QTUM input.\nIf you want to split your coins into different addresses inside your VPS wallet, type the following to obtain new addresses inside your wallet: qtum-cli getnewaddress\nEach time you type this, you’ll get a new address, QTUM can generate any amount of addresses you want, but please keep in mind, if you do go over 100 new address, you might want to make a new backup of your wallet.\nWallet Backup\nBacking up your wallet from a Linux VPS is different from a desktop but not too complicated, there's several ways to do this, and here are some steps which should work on all major desktop OS.\nFirst, we'll download Filezilla, which is an easy to use and secure FTP/SFTP server\nhttps://filezilla-project.org\n\nInstalling is just like any other windows app.\n\nWhen the installer finishes, we launch Filezilla and are greeted with this screen, let's proceed and add our previously created ssh-key\nWe go into Edit -> Settings -> SFTP. This will give us the following screen in which we will be able to import our SSH key.\n\nPlease note that Filezilla only accepts the private key which is created when the ssh-key was generated.\n Here we've already added the ssh key, now we can log into our server\n\nwe enter our VPS ip address + username (root in this case),  leave a blank password because we're using ssh-key to login \nJust press ok when prompted, and you'll be able to log in. \n\nHere we can see the /root/ folder of our VPS, this is where our wallet runs and has the wallet stored in /root/.qtum we can go ahead and double click the folder which will show us the following: \nNow all we need to do is scroll down to wallet.dat, right click and select download from the list. This will download the wallet.dat file to our computer, we've successfully backed up our Qtum wallet!.\nUpdating wallet\nIf you installed Qtum the old way (without using the repository)\nWe highly recommend using the repository from now on, however, if you still want to compile the wallet yourself, here’s how to upgrade:\n(Backup your wallet.dat first)\ncd ~/qtum/\ngit pull\n./configure\nmake\nqtum-cli stop\nmake install\nqtumd -daemon\nWhat happened there?\n\nWe updated the sources from the original build folder (if you don’t have it anymore, you need to pull the entire repo as was shown in the beginning of this tutorial).\nWe configured and built the new Qtum daemon\nWe stopped the old daemon\nWe installed the new daemon\nWe executed the new daemon\n\nIf you installed Qtum using the repo\nIf you used the repository to install your Qtum wallet, it’s very easy to upgrade to a new version, all you have to do is the following:\napt update && apt upgrade\nThis will update the apt sources on your Linux box and install the latest packages, Qtum included.

New modules are introduced to meet the following enterprise requirements:\n\nHigh TPS (Transactions Per Second) and short confirmation time. \nCustomizable settings for using in various usage scenarios.\n\nConsensus Algorithm\nConsortium Blockchain and Proof of Authority\nBlockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Qtum are called public blockchains. They have no access restriction. Anyone can send transactions to them as well as participate in the block creation process. In these cases, many consensus algorithms are developed, such as PoW (Proof of Work) and PoS (Proof of Stake), allowing a large number of users to reach a consensus about who can mine new blocks. These blockchains are generally considered to be fully decentralized.\nA consortium blockchain is often said to be partially decentralized, where the consensus process is executed by a small group of authorized nodes. For example, a consortium of three game companies plan to launch a blockchain with cryptocurrencies which can be spent in their games. Each of them runs a node to verify transactions and mine blocks. Game players, however, only have access to reading blocks and sending transactions. In this situation, just the three authorized nodes need to reach a consensus on block producing.\nFor consortium blockchains, the consensus algorithm is usually called PoA (Proof of Authority). Instead of solving a difficult mathematical problem in PoW or holding a large amount of cryptocurrencies in PoS, in PoA, a list of authorized block miners is used to determine which nodes are allowed to create new blocks. The chain has to be signed by the majority of miners, then it becomes a permanent record. It is more efficient and secure since the miners are fewer and more reliable.\nA BFT type Consensus Algorithm\nHere we introduce a PoA consensus algorithm which will be available in the Qtum Enterprise version. It is a BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) type algorithm and is always addressed as the signed-message solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem [1]. Each block has to be signed by its miner and the system stops producing new blocks only when half or more than half of the authorized nodes are down. We illustrate the entire algorithm here first and describe it in detail in the following paragraphs.\n\nTo help explain this algorithm we assume there are 5 authorized block miners, A, B, C, D, E. Their public keys are stored in an ordered list. This list is initialized at the very beginning of the blockchain and can be updated later by a smart contract. So we suppose that, at block height h1, the current_authorized_miner_list is [pubkey_A, pubkey_B, pubkey_C, pubkey_D, pubkey_E]\n. Then these 5 block miners will take turns producing a new block, from height h1 to h2, like the illustration below.\n\nWhen producing a new block, the miner has to use the secp256k1_ecdsa_sign_recoverable function to sign the block and then add the output signature to the block. By this way, other nodes can recover the miner's public key from the signature by using the function secp256k1_ecdsa_recover, and then verify its authority through the current_authorized_miner_list.\nThe chain which is signed by the majority of authorized miners can be regarded as a permanent record. For example, in the illustration above, the blockchain from the genesis to the height of h3 is permanent, since it has been verified and signed by its following block miners D, E and A. If anyone tries to create a fork at a height lower than h3, it will never be followed by the majority of authorized miners.\nTherefore, at least n/2+1 miners are needed to keep the algorithm working, where n is the total number of authorized block miners and n/2 is a integer division. In our example n=5, so at least 3 nodes are need. That is, nodes A, B, C can continue to mine new blocks when D, E are shutdown. The output blockchain, which would be like ABCABC, is valid. This consensus algorithm can be simply defined as follows:\n\nOne miner can mine the next block when:\n\nIt is currently authorized.\nRecent n/2 blocks are not mined by it. \n\n\nBy this definition, we are able to obtain the miners which are actually allowed to mine the next block. It simply requires removing miners of the recent n/2 blocks from the current_authorized_miner_list. For example, at the height h2, the next_block_miner_list can be calculated as.\n\nAlthough B, C, D all can mine the next block, a priority order should be specified for them, so as to avoid their competition for the next block and ensure the blockchain would be verified by as many miners as possible. Therefore, we define the next_block_miner_list as an ordered list, where the miner next to the current block miner in current_authorized_miner_list is supposed to be at the first place, and so on. In our example, the order of B, C, E is shown in the illustration above.\nWhen the priority order is determined, the block_time for each miner is calculated afterwards. The miner with a higher order in the next_block_miner_list is assigned an earlier block_time. Each miner uses the assigned block_time to create a new block and keeps waiting until the block_time. If no block is received during the waiting, the miner will then broadcast its block. The calculation of block_time is illustrated as:\n\nIn this way, if one node fails to mine a block, the next miner will take place after timeout later. Here is an example. Node B is down when producing the block at height h2+1. Then node C, which is next to B in next_block_miner_list, will broadcast its block interval+timeout after parent_block_time.\n\nDGP for Authorities Storage and Update\nDGP (Decentralized Governance Protocol) [2] is a technology used in Qtum, which allows blockchain parameters to be modified through a specially designed smart contract on the blockchain, without any disruption to the ecosystem like soft or hard forks.\nThe way the DGP works is relatively straightforward. First, a governing party for the DGP makes a proposal to change a parameter. Afterward, all the governing parties for the DGP can vote on the proposal, and if it receives enough approval votes, then the parameter change proposal becomes active. The proposal data is then placed in a standardized format and a particular storage space so that the blockchain software can easily access it without needing to execute the DGP contract directly.\nObviously, the DGP is also a suitable method for the storage and update of the authorized block miners in PoA. The miners, actually a list of public keys, can be initialized by a config file and then updated by the DGP. But here we should make a little modification to the DGP so that the update process can be more secure.\n\nThe new miner list activated by the DGP should take effect a few blocks later, when the activation is verified and signed by n/2+1 miners of the previous list. \n\nHere, n is the length of the previous list and n/2 represents a integer division. This mechanism ensures that the update process takes effect when it becomes a permanent record in the blockchain. Otherwise, if the update process can be denied by another fork, it is possible for those previous miners to work on that fork and even cause a hard fork afterwards.\nBlock Reward\nDifferent from the coinstake in PoS, block miners of PoA are rewarded in the coinbase for simplicity. The contract refund, which is generated by the contract execution in Qtum, should be added to the coinbase as well. Therefore, the coinbase in PoA contains one or more outputs. The first one is paid to the block miner and its amount equals to the sum of transaction fees and block subsidy, while others are contract refund outputs.\nCustomizable Settings\nWe will try to make most parameters configurable in the Enterprise version. So that the system can be easily applied to various usage scenarios. Some customizable settings are listed as follows:\n\nThe genesis block: block_time, coinbase.\nNetwork parameters: pchMessageStart, seeds.\nParameters for the PoA consensus algorithm: interval, timeout.\nBlock reward parameters: initial value, nSubsidyHalvingInterval\n\nReferences\n[1] Driscoll, Kevin; Hall, Brendan; Sivencrona, Håkan; Zumsteg, Phil. \"Byzantine Fault Tolerance, from Theory to Reality\". \n[2] qtum.org. \"Qtum's Decentralized Governance Protocol\". \n"},"Guidance-of-Qtum-Deployment-and-RPC-Settings.html":{"url":"Guidance-of-Qtum-Deployment-and-RPC-Settings.html","title":"如何部署 Qtum 量子链节点","keywords":"","body":"如何部署Qtum量子链节点\n本教程包含Qtum量子链的部署、运行以及RPC调用等内容。\n教程假设读者能够熟练使用Linux,Mac或Windows命令行。若您不符合此要求，或只关心Qtum qt钱包的使用方法，请参考另一篇Qtum钱包使用教程。\n获取Qtum节点\n可以通过以下四种方法之一获得Qtum节点程序：\n1. 直接下载二进制文件\n如果你并不关心Qtum的源码，部署Qtum节点最方便的方法是在Qtum release page（点击打开）下载最新的二进制文件，目前支持的平台包括Linux，Window，OSX。建议选择最新版进行下载，本教程以撰写时的最新版v0.14.13为例。\n（注意，你所看到最新版的版本号可能不同，如这里是0.14.13，其他字符串保持不变）\n\nMac用户请下载：qtum-0.14.13-osx64.tar.gz\nLinux用户请下载： qtum-0.14.13-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz(32位)或qtum-0.14.13-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz(64位)\nWindows用户请下载：qtum-0.14.13-win32.zip(32位)或qtum-0.14.13-win64.zip（64位）\n树莓派用户请下载：qtum-0.14.13-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\n\n下载压缩包解压后,/bin/下包含qtumd和qtum-cli，即为本教程要用到的Qtum节点可执行文件。\n2. Linux可通过apt安装\n具体教程可参见https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Setting-up-QTUM-Ubuntu,-Debian-and-Mint-repository，目前支持的平台为Ubuntu，Debian和Mint。\n树莓派用户也可以通过apt安装，具体教程参见https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Installing-Qtum-on-Raspberry-Pi。\n按照教程安装完毕后，可以通过直接从命令行调用qtumd和qtum-cli等。\n3. 通过源代码编译\n如果你想从源代码直接编译Qtum，可以从Github上下载最新源码: https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum。\n具体编译方法请参考 https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/README.md。目前支持较好的编译平台包括Linux和OSX。其他平台的依赖环境可能有所不同。\n编译成功后，在/src路径下同样得到上文的二进制可执行文件：qtumd,qtum-cli。\n4. 通过Docker获取qtum镜像\n关于docker安装和使用方法请参照docker官方教程。这里假设docker环境已正确安装。\nQtum官方在docker hub上的镜像为qtum/qtum,可通过以下命令获取：\ndocker pull qtum/qtum:latest\n通过上文方法获取qtum可执行程序，其中与节点部署及RPC调用相关的是：\n\nqtumd：Qtum核心程序，即真正的Qtum全节点程序\nqtum-cli：Qtum命令行接口，可以和Qtum核心程序进行交互，实现本地RPC调用\n\n部署Qtum节点\nDocker容器的使用方法略有不同，但原理一致。读者可参考另一教程《如何用docker运行qtum节点》。\n下面以Ubuntu为例，部署Qtum节点。Mac和Window命令行与Linux保持一致，不再赘述。\n通过./qtumd, 即可运行Qtum全节点：\n./qtumd -daemon\n其中-daemon表示进程后台驻留。如果用户想通过节点查看合约相关events（如查看收发QRC20代币的记录等），可以在运行qtumd是添加-logevents选项。\n 更多选项，可通过以下命令查看：\n./qtumd -help\n结束运行请执行：\n./qtum-cli stop\n不同平台的默认的数据路径不同：\n\nLinux：~/.qtum/\nMac OSX：~/Library/Application Support/Qtum\nWindows:%APPDATA%\\Qtum\n\n首次运行如果默认路径不为空，请清空之后再运行节点（清空前注意备份！）。读者也可以通过-datadir选项指定数据路径。\n首次运行需要同步所有区块，节点运行日志路径为~/.qtum/debug.log。\n本地RPC调用\n节点正常运行后，可通过qtum-cli进行交互，实现本地RPC调用。\n例如：\noldclock@raven:~/qtum-0.14.3/bin$ ./qtum-cli getinfo\n{\n  \"version\": 140300,\n  \"protocolversion\": 70016,\n  \"walletversion\": 130000,\n  \"balance\": 0.00000000,\n  \"stake\": 0.00000000,\n  \"blocks\": 12126,\n  \"timeoffset\": 0,\n  \"connections\": 8,\n  \"proxy\": \"\",\n  \"difficulty\": {\n    \"proof-of-work\": 1.52587890625e-05,\n    \"proof-of-stake\": 886731.5868738915\n  },\n  \"testnet\": false,\n  \"moneysupply\": 100028504,\n  \"keypoololdest\": 1505186997,\n  \"keypoolsize\": 100,\n  \"paytxfee\": 0.00000000,\n  \"relayfee\": 0.00400000,\n  \"errors\": \"\"\n}\n获取所有RPC命令列表，请运行:\n./qtum-cli help\n获取RPC调用的使用说明，请使用./qtum-cli help ，例如：\n./qtum-cli help getinfo\nRPC调用设置\n通过./qtum-cli help getinfo我们可以获取通过jsonrpc实现getinfo调用的使用说明：\nExamples:\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getinfo\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:3889/\n实例中给出了json报文的详细格式，但默认条件下无法进行调用。只有在设置rpc用户名和密码后，才可正常使用。设置方法如下：\n方法一：新建配置文件~/.qtum/qtum.conf，内容包含\nrpcuser=test  #rpc用户名\nrpcpassword=test1234  #rpc密码\n#以上两项必须设置。默认情况下，只允许本地的RPC连接，\n#要实现远程调用，可通过设置rpcallowip声明所有允许访问的ip\n#ipv4和ipv6都可设置，且可是设置多个ip。例如：\n#rpcallowip=192.168.77.51/255.255.255.0\n#rpcallowip=1.2.3.4/24\n#rpcallowip=2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8a2e:370:7334/96\n更多配置参数可以参考：qtum.conf实例（点击打开）\n设置完成后，重启节点即完成配置。\n方法二：重新运行Qtum节点，并加入特定参数：\n./qtumd -rpcuser=test -rpcpassword=test1234 -rpcallowip=192.168.77.51/255.255.255.0\n各参数含义与配置文件中相同，不再赘述。\nRPC调用实例\n设置完成并重新运行节点后，即可进行远程RPC调用。本文中运行Qtum节点的服务器ip为192.168.77.188，默认端口为3889。例如，在macbook上对ubuntu中运行的Qtum节点进行rpc调用，将返回和本地调用相同结果：\nzhongwenbins-MacBook-Pro:~ zhongwenbin$ curl --user test:test1234 --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getinfo\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://192.168.77.188:3889/\n{\"result\":{\"version\":140300,\"protocolversion\":70016,\"walletversion\":130000,\"balance\":0.00000000,\"stake\":0.00000000,\"blocks\":12197,\"timeoffset\":0,\"connections\":8,\"proxy\":\"\",\"difficulty\":{\"proof-of-work\":1.52587890625e-05,\"proof-of-stake\":650787.7561123729},\"testnet\":false,\"moneysupply\":100028788,\"keypoololdest\":1505186997,\"keypoolsize\":100,\"paytxfee\":0.00000000,\"relayfee\":0.00400000,\"errors\":\"\"},\"error\":null,\"id\":\"curltest\"}\n用postman等工具可看到更加直观的效果：\n\n自此Qtum节点的部署及rpc调用设置全部完成。\nNginx配置实例（选读）\n从上文实例可以看出，rpc命令必须包含rpc用户名，密码，并指定端口号3889。如果想部署通用API，避免输入用户密码及端口号，可以考虑用Nginx实现。这样做的好处是可以隐藏用户名和密码，当用户名密码甚至是端口号发生改变时，也不影响api，同时还可以对外部rpc调用进行适当过滤，保证安全性。关于Nginx的安装和基本使用，可自行搜索相关教程。\n例如，\n\n运行Qtum节点的服务端ip为192.168.77.188，节点正常运行\napi代理端ip为192.168.77.51，已安装Nginx\n\n设置步骤如下：\n1.设置服务端Qtum节点的rpc配置文件（参考上文），将api代理端的ip加入rpcallowip中，并重启节点，例如：\nrpcuser=test\nrpcpassword=test1234\nrpcallowip=192.168.77.51/255.255.255.0\n2.配置代理端Nginx：\n    server {\n        listen       80;\n        server_name  localhost;\n\n        location / {\n            proxy_pass http://192.168.77.188:3889;  #反代到端口3889\n            proxy_set_header Authorization \"Basic dGVzdDp0ZXN0MTIzNA==\";  #本例中为test:test1234的base64编码\n        }\n    }\n3.设置完成后，直接访问代理端即可进行RPC调用(无需输入用户名密码和端口号)，如：\nzhongwenbins-MacBook-Pro:~ zhongwenbin$ curl  --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getinfo\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://192.168.77.51/\n{\"result\":{\"version\":140300,\"protocolversion\":70016,\"walletversion\":130000,\"balance\":0.00000000,\"stake\":0.00000000,\"blocks\":12250,\"timeoffset\":0,\"connections\":8,\"proxy\":\"\",\"difficulty\":{\"proof-of-work\":1.52587890625e-05,\"proof-of-stake\":651324.7815933984},\"testnet\":false,\"moneysupply\":100029000,\"keypoololdest\":1505186997,\"keypoolsize\":100,\"paytxfee\":0.00000000,\"relayfee\":0.00400000,\"errors\":\"\"},\"error\":null,\"id\":\"curltest\"}\n以上设置实例仅供参考，读者可根据自身需求作更多设置，或是选择其它工具代替。\n实用命令和文档\n读者在部署节点或RPC调用时遇到问题，可优先参考以下实用命令或文档：\n\n编译问题参考文档： https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/README.md。\n查看qtumd的所有选项：./qtumd -help\n查看所有rpc命令： ./qtum-cli help\n查看某rpc命令使用说明（如getinfo）： ./qtum-cli help getinfo\n配置文件示例：qtum.conf（点击打开）\n\n"},"Encrypt-and-Unlock-Qtum-Wallet/":{"url":"Encrypt-and-Unlock-Qtum-Wallet/","title":"锁定、解锁 Qtum 钱包","keywords":"","body":"锁定、解锁Qtum钱包\n如果您未运行Qtum节点，请先参考如下教程安装Qtum钱包：\n\n命令行用户参考：《如何部署Qtum量子链节点》\n图形界面钱包请从这里下载：https://eco.qtum.org/wallet\n\n加密钱包或更改密码后，请务必重新备份您的钱包！\n请在安装并运行钱包后，再进行以下步骤：\n锁定钱包\n命令行用户\n锁定钱包的命令为：\n./qtum-cli encryptwallet \"yourpassword\"\n其中yourpassword为用户自定义的密码。请用户务必牢记密码！\n锁定后所有资金安全相关操作（如发送QTUM，dump私钥等）都需要先解锁钱包才能执行。\n带用户界面钱包\n菜单栏中选择Setting-Encrypt Wallet\n\n输入密码并确认。设置成功后钱包会重新启动。\n\n钱包重启后，会在右下角显示锁定标志，表示钱包已加锁：\n\n解锁钱包\n命令行用户\n解锁钱包的命令为：\n./qtum-cli walletpassphrase \"yourpassword\" 99999\n其中第一个参数yourpassword为之前设定的密码；第二个参数为需要解锁的时间，单位是秒。\n解锁后即可正常发送QTUM或进行其他资金安全相关操作。\n如果只想解锁Staking（挖矿）功能，可以用一下命令：\n./qtum-cli walletpassphrase \"yourpassword\" 99999 true\n其中前两个参数含义不变，最后一个参数true表示只解锁挖矿功能，用该命令解锁后，钱包可以正常挖矿，但其他资金安全相关操作仍被禁止，只有完全解锁后才能使用。\n带用户界面钱包\n选择“Settings-unlock wallet”解锁钱包：\n\n输入密码，解锁钱包。其中For staking only选框，若勾选，表示只解锁staking（挖矿），即可正常挖矿，但如需发送QTUM仍需输入密码。如果不勾选，则表示完全解锁。\n\n解锁后钱包界面右下角的锁标志变为打开状态。\n修改密码\n命令行用户\n修改密码的命令为：\n./qtum-cli walletpassphrasechange \"oldpassphrase\" \"newpassphrase\"\n第一个参数oldpassphrase表示原来的密码，第二个参数newpassphrase为新密码。\n带用户界面钱包\n选择“Setting-Change Passphrase”修改密码：\n\n输入老密码和新密码，完成修改：\n\n"}}}
