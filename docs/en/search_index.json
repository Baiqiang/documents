that may have taken place, both incoming and outgoing transactions are displayed, this includes staked coins as well.\nBasic wallet functions\nOn the left side of the wallet, we can find basic wallet functionality such as:\n\nSend\nReceive\nSmart Contract\nTransactions (This is a more detailed and full historical set of transactions)\n\nSend Menu\nOn the send menu, we have different functions, all are quite basic to learn and use.\n\nPay to: Here we’ll enter the address we want to send Qtum to (Only Qtum ignition addresses will work).\nLabel:  Optional, as it’s stated, it’s just a name/tag\nAmount: Here we enter the amount of Qtum we want to Send\nOnce all fields are covered, we can click on the “Send” button and the Qtum coins will be sent to the address we entered above.\nReceive\nHere we can display our Qtum wallet address and even generate new ones!\nThis is useful for receiving payments from more than one sender and helps you keep track of each transaction.\n\nTo obtain the deposit address, simply click on “Request Payment” and you’ll see a popup dialog show up with your Qtum wallet deposit address. Here you can receive coins from your exchange or from other users. For this tutorial, we’ll do a test deposit of 54.9 Qtum.\nTransactions\nHere you can see both incoming and outgoing transactions, shows all historical transactions, on the screenshot we have a pending transaction with a few confirmations.\n\nWallet Encryption\nFirst, let’s encrypt this wallet before making the backup, this will allow the backup to be encrypted as well. Go to settings -> Encrypt wallet.\n\nNext, let’s enter the password for this wallet, please remember this password because without it you’ll lose access to your Qtum.\n\nAfter the password is entered and accepted, the wallet will restart and it'll be encrypted.\nWallet Backup\nIt's recommended to make the backup after encrypting the wallet.\n\nTo access the backup option, we go into File/Backup Wallet and then we enter route and name.\nAfter the backup’s name is entered and we’ve verified the route where the wallet is being saved to, we can click on save. Now we’ve successfully backed up our wallet.\nRestore wallet backup\nRecent versions of the QTUM wallet have implemented backup management from the UI.

This will update all installed packages while also installing any available security updates.\n\nOnce we finish the update, let's proceed to installing dependencies and cloning the qtum sources from Github.\n\n### Enabling SWAP\n\n##### This step is necessary as most VPS don't come with SWAP enabled and it'll cause low-ram compilation errors, here's how to create SWAP.\n\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=2048\n chmod 600 /swapfile\nmkswap /swapfile\nswapon /swapfile\necho \"/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0\" >> /etc/fstab\nThis creates a 2GB swap file which will allow you to build and run Qtum without issues.\n\n### Compiling Qtum\n\nThis is a quick start script for compiling Qtum on  Ubuntu\n\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libssl-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils git cmake libboost-all-dev\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev\n\n# If you want to build the Qt GUI:\nsudo apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler\n\ngit clone https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum --recursive\ncd qtum\n\n# Note autogen will prompt to install some more dependencies if needed\n./autogen.sh\n./configure\nmake -j2\nmake install\nCompiling Qtum takes a while, it depends a lot on your VPS resources, it can take anywhere from 3 minutes to 20+ minutes.\nOnce the process is finished, you'll have all qtum executables in /usr/local/bin/ you can check by typing\nls /usr/local/bin/\nLaunching Qtum daemon\n qtumd -daemon  -> This launches the qtum daemon and the blockchain begins to synchronize right after launching. It can take some minutes before it's fully synced.\nEncrypting wallet\nWe can encrypt the wallet at any time, it's better to do it before we go any further.\nTo do this, type the following on the command line:\nqtum-cli encryptwallet yourpassword\nThis will encrypt the wallet which in turn closes the daemon, you'll see the following message:\nwallet encrypted; Qtum server stopping, restart to run with encrypted wallet. The keypool has been flushed and a new HD seed was generated (if you are using HD). You need to make a new backup.\n\nqtum-cli getaccountaddress \"\" -> Right after launching the daemon, you can obtain your wallet address by typing this.\nYou can send Qtum coins to the address we just obtained from the daemon, please remember that those transactions require at least 500+ confirmations before they become mature enough for staking.\nStaking\nNow that we've waited until we have at least 501 confirmations on our received transaction, we are elligible for staking, however, if our wallet is encrypted (which we did for security reasons) we won't be able to stake, let's open our wallet for staking using the command line!.\nqtum-cli walletpassphrase password 999999999 true\nThe above command will unlock the walet for staking only for 31.6 Years! that should be enough for now. Please note, this will not unlock your backup, only the wallet that's running right now.\nNow that we've unlocked our wallet, we need to wait until we have more than 501 confirmations to be elligible for staking, if we already do, it's a matter of time which will vary depending on the network weight vs your wallet's weight.\nChecking Balance\nTo check your balance, type qtum-cli getinfo this will show general information, including your available balance and balance in staking\nCheck transactions\nTo check your transactions (incoming and outgoing) type qtum-cli listtransactions\nCheck staking info\nTo check Qtum's staking information, type qtum-cli getstakinginfo\nStaking tips\nStaking really depends on network weight vs your wallet’s weight which is based on the amount of coins you have, higher weight increases your chances of staking a block.\nIf you have a large amount of coins, it’s a good idea to split those up in separate transactions, for instance, if you have 10.000 QTUM, it’s better to send 10 transactions of 1000 QTUM each to your wallet, each one generates a UTXO input which will take part in staking. This optimizes the staking process and works much better than just one large 10.000 QTUM input.\nIf you want to split your coins into different addresses inside your VPS wallet, type the following to obtain new addresses inside your wallet: qtum-cli getnewaddress\nEach time you type this, you’ll get a new address, QTUM can generate any amount of addresses you want, but please keep in mind, if you do go over 100 new address, you might want to make a new backup of your wallet.\nWallet Backup\nBacking up your wallet from a Linux VPS is different from a desktop but not too complicated, there's several ways to do this, and here are some steps which should work on all major desktop OS.\nFirst, we'll download Filezilla, which is an easy to use and secure FTP/SFTP server\nhttps://filezilla-project.org\n\nInstalling is just like any other windows app.\n\nWhen the installer finishes, we launch Filezilla and are greeted with this screen, let's proceed and add our previously created ssh-key\nWe go into Edit -> Settings -> SFTP. This will give us the following screen in which we will be able to import our SSH key.\n\nPlease note that Filezilla only accepts the private key which is created when the ssh-key was generated.\n Here we've already added the ssh key, now we can log into our server\n\nwe enter our VPS ip address + username (root in this case),  leave a blank password because we're using ssh-key to login \nJust press ok when prompted, and you'll be able to log in. \n\nHere we can see the /root/ folder of our VPS, this is where our wallet runs and has the wallet stored in /root/.qtum we can go ahead and double click the folder which will show us the following: \nNow all we need to do is scroll down to wallet.dat, right click and select download from the list. This will download the wallet.dat file to our computer, we've successfully backed up our Qtum wallet!.\nUpdating wallet\nIf you installed Qtum the old way (without using the repository)\nWe highly recommend using the repository from now on, however, if you still want to compile the wallet yourself, here’s how to upgrade:\n(Backup your wallet.dat first)\ncd ~/qtum/\ngit pull\n./configure\nmake\nqtum-cli stop\nmake install\nqtumd -daemon\nWhat happened there?\n\nWe updated the sources from the original build folder (if you don’t have it anymore, you need to pull the entire repo as was shown in the beginning of this tutorial).\nWe configured and built the new Qtum daemon\nWe stopped the old daemon\nWe installed the new daemon\nWe executed the new daemon\n\nIf you installed Qtum using the repo\nIf you used the repository to install your Qtum wallet, it’s very easy to upgrade to a new version, all you have to do is the following:\napt update && apt upgrade\nThis will update the apt sources on your Linux box and install the latest packages, Qtum included. If you only want to upgrade Qtum:\napt update && apt install —only-upgrade qtum\n"},"Qtum-on-Raspberry-Pi/":{"url":"Qtum-on-Raspberry-Pi/","title":"Stake With Raspberry Pi","keywords":"","body":"Qtum on Raspberry Pi\nJust like we did on Debian, we need to download and install Qtum's public key\nwget -qO - http://repo.qtum.info/apt/public.key | sudo apt-key add -\nThis downloads and installs the Qtum public key\nAdding repository to your APT sources.\nsudo su - Sudo to root first\necho \"deb http://repo.qtum.info/apt/raspbian/ jessie main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list\nor\necho \"deb http://repo.qtum.info/apt/raspbian/ stretch main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list\nThis will add the repository to your APT sources file.\nRefreshing APT sources and installing Qtum\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install qtum\nBy doing this, we'll update our sources and install Qtum on our raspberry Box, which can act now as a staking server/node.\nChanging default password\nThis option is recommended for security reasons, the default password on the pi is well known, it's highly recommended to change it upon first login.\nTo change just type: passwd\nThe prompt will ask you to write and repeat the new password to confirm.\nProtecting access with a basic firewall\nWell, our raspberry is only for staking, there's no need to have all those ports open, let's close everything we don't need and only allow access to necesary services.\nFirst, let's install UFW (uncomplicated firewall) which is an easy-to-use interface for iptables\nsudo apt install ufw\nOnce this is installed, we proceed with access permissions, we will define which ports will be accessible. Let's check first what's open:\nsudo ufw status This should show something like this: \nStatus: active\nTo               Action      From\n--               ------      ----\n22               ALLOW       Anywhere\nOk so it's time to start closing down access, type the following:\nsudo ufw default deny incoming\nsudo ufw allow 3888/tcp\nsudo ufw allow 3889/tcp\nHere we've defined the basics, closing down everything except port 3888 and 3889 which are used by Qtum to function.\nIf you're using SSH, it's recommended to only allow access from local network.\nsudo ufw allow from 196.168.0.0/24 to any port 22\nLaunching Qtum daemon\nAll we need to do to launch the Qtum daemon is type:\nqtumd -daemon\nAs soon as you type this, the wallet will create the wallet.dat file among other files (if they’re not already there). The wallet will run and begin syncing instantly from the other Blockchain nodes, this can take a few hours to complete so you can go ahead and have some coffee and let it synchronize.\nEncrypting wallet\nWe can encrypt the wallet at any time, it's better to do it before we go any further.\nTo do this, type the following on the command line:\nqtum-cli encryptwallet yourpassword\nThis will encrypt the wallet which in turn closes the daemon, you'll see the following message:\nwallet encrypted; Qtum server stopping, restart to run with encrypted wallet. If you alreadby backed up before encrypting, you  need to make a new backup. \nqtum-cli getaccountaddress \"\" -> Right after launching the daemon, you can obtain your wallet address by typing this.\nYou can send Qtum coins to the address we just obtained from the daemon, please remember that those transactions require at least 500+ confirmations before they become mature enough for staking.\nStaking\nNow that we've waited until we have at least 501 confirmations on our received transaction, we are elligible for staking, however, if our wallet is encrypted (which we did for security reasons) we won't be able to stake, let's open our wallet for staking using the command line!.\nqtum-cli walletpassphrase password 999999999 true\nThe above command will unlock the walet for 31.6 Years! that should be enough for now.

In any case, updating is a breeze, all you have to do is type\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install —only-upgrade qtum\n"}}}
