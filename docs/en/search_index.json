Documentation\n"},"Qtum-Wallet-Tutorial/":{"url":"Qtum-Wallet-Tutorial/","title":"Desktop wallet basic usage","keywords":"","body":"Qtum QT Wallet Tutorial\nMy Wallet\nThis is the Qtum wallet “My Wallet” page, it shows the following:\nBalances\n\nAvailable\nPending\nTotal\n\nOther Tokens\nIf we own any tokens, they'll show here, including balance and contract info.\n\nTransactions\nThis shows any transaction that may have taken place, both incoming and outgoing transactions are displayed, this includes staked coins as well.\nBasic wallet functions\nOn the left side of the wallet, we can find basic wallet functionality such as:\n\nSend\nReceive\nSmart Contract\nTransactions (This is a more detailed and full historical set of transactions)\n\nSend Menu\nOn the send menu, we have different functions, all are quite basic to learn and use.\n\nPay to: Here we’ll enter the address we want to send Qtum to (Only Qtum ignition addresses will work).\nLabel:  Optional, as it’s stated, it’s just a name/tag\nAmount: Here we enter the amount of Qtum we want to Send\nOnce all fields are covered, we can click on the “Send” button and the Qtum coins will be sent to the address we entered above.\nReceive\nHere we can display our Qtum wallet address and even generate new ones!\nThis is useful for receiving payments from more than one sender and helps you keep track of each transaction.\n\nTo obtain the deposit address, simply click on “Request Payment” and you’ll see a popup dialog show up with your Qtum wallet deposit address. Here you can receive coins from your exchange or from other users. For this tutorial, we’ll do a test deposit of 54.9 Qtum.\nTransactions\nHere you can see both incoming and outgoing transactions, shows all historical transactions, on the screenshot we have a pending transaction with a few confirmations.\n\nWallet Encryption\nFirst, let’s encrypt this wallet before making the backup, this will allow the backup to be encrypted as well.

In the \"bin\" directory will be the two programs of interest, qtumd and qtum-cli\nIf you choose to compile it yourself instead, follow these steps on Ubuntu:\nInstall packages if needed:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libssl-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils git cmake libboost-all-dev\n\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev\ngit clone https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum --recursive\ngit checkout mainnet-ignition-v1.0.1 # or use the latest release\n./autogen.sh\n./configure --with-gui=no --enable-hardening\nmake -j3\nAfterwards, in the \"src\" directory, there will be two programs of interest, qtumd and qtum-cli\nStartup\nIn order to startup qtumd, use the following:\n./qtumd -daemon -staking=0\nAdditional options can be specified in ~/.qtum/qtum.conf, you can add -staking=0 in the qtum.conf file\nAfterwards, you can check the status of the Qtum node:\n./qtum-cli getinfo\nIt will show a block count. when the block count matches the latest block on our block explorer: https://explorer.qtum.org then that means that the node is synchronized. If it shows 0 blocks and 0 connections for more than a few minutes, contact Qtum staff for help. Syncing the blockchain will take around 10-30 minutes depending on connection speed\nIn order to shut down the node, simply use:\n./qtum-cli stop\nNOTE: -staking=false disables automatic staking in the wallet. This is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for exchanges. Staking can make an unpredictable amount of coins unaccessible for 500 blocks (~20 hours) and so it is recommended that exchanges do not participate in staking.\nWallet Backup\nMake sure to always back up your wallet! The location of the wallet file on Linux is ~/.qtum/wallet.dat. Make sure to shut down the node before making a backup to avoid data corruption.\nThe wallet can also be encrypted on-disk:\n./qtum-cli encryptwallet \"your strong password\"\nThe Qtum node will automatically stop itself in order to encrypt the wallet. You will need to execute ./qtumd -daemon -staking=false again afterwards to start the node again\nIMPORTANT: after encrypting the wallet YOU MUST make a new backup of the wallet.dat file. Failing to do so can result in LOSS OF COINS. If the password to the encrypted wallet is lost, there is NO WAY TO RECOVER THE COINS. Make sure to take backups of both wallet.dat, as well as the password used for encryption!\nIn order to unlock the wallet:\n./qtum-cli walletpassphrase \"your strong password\" XXX\nXXX is how many seconds to keep the wallet unlocked for. So, specifying that as \"1000\" would mean keep the wallet unlocked for 1000 seconds.\nFor an exchange it is probably best to not use wallet encryption on the hot wallet. In the above example, after 1000 seconds have passed, it is necessary to unlock the wallet again. This may cause some problems depending on your exact exchange systems\nNOTE: Unlocking the wallet is only required to send coins. If you only need to receive coins and track transactions, this can be done with an encrypted and locked wallet\nReceiving coins\nIn order to generate a new address:\n./qtum-cli getnewaddress \"\"\nThis will generate a unique address every time it is executed. Note Qtum addresses start with Q for standard pubkeyhash addresses, and start with M for multi-sig addresses\nTo validate an address is valid:\n./qtum-cli validateaddress \"address here\"\nIn order to see the coins received by a particular address (note the address must be owned by this wallet. This does not allow checking addresses not owned by this wallet):\n./qtum-cli getreceivedbyaddress \"address here\" MINCONF\nIn this case, MINCONF is how many confirmations the transaction must have had on the blockchain before it will be included in this number.\nMinimum confirmations recommended by Qtum:\n\n20 confirmations for very large amounts and for any amount during the first month of the mainnet launch\n10 confirmations for small and medium amounts after 1 month when the network is proven stable\n\nTo get all transactions (including unconfirmed!) currently tracked by the wallet use this function:\n./qtum-cli listtransactions \"*\" COUNT SKIP\nCOUNT and SKIP can be used for paging through transactions. Using a very large count value may cause the node to perform the request slowly, and so it is recommended to never use a COUNT that is more than 100. SKIP is used to skip the first number of results. It is not recommended to rely only on this for the accounting of an exchange. It is possible that while you are iterating to discover the full transaction list, that someone sends a transaction to the wallet that will be missed. Also, this method includes UNCONFIRMED transactions and must be used with caution.\nWARNING: Bitcoind and thus qtumd has some account functionality so that different addresses can use different accounts. DO NOT RELY ON THIS. This feature is deprecated and has many security problems, and will be removed in the next release.\nSending Coins\nIt is not easily possible to dictate what address coins should be sent from. If your exchange system relies on this, you should make a workaround in your system so that this is not necessary.\nIn order to send coins:\n./qtum-cli sendtoaddress \"address to send to\" AMOUNT \"comment about tx\" \"comment about address\" SUBTRACTFEE\nThe \"comment\" arguments can be left blank if unneeded. These comments are saved within your wallet file and are used by some exchanges to track internal withdraw and user IDs.\nThe SUBTRACTFEE option can be either \"true\" or \"false\". When this option is true, it subtracts the fee from the amount sent. So, if you do\n./qtum-cli sendtoaddress \"address\" 10 \"\" \"\" true\nAnd the network fee is 0.1 Qtum, then the actual amount that the user will receive will be 9.9 Qtum. If SUBTRACTFEE is instead set to false, then they will receive 10, but your wallet will have paid 0.1 Qtum for the network fee.\nNOTE: Exchange users should not be capable of sending coins directly to a smart contract address (one starting with 0x). These addresses will be rejected by sendtoaddress and proper usage requires significantly more caution to properly use.\nParameters\n\nRecommended tx fee: 400000sat or 0.004 Qtum per kilobyte of tx data (2kb is reasonable transaction size expectation, but it can sometimes be more)\nRecommended confirmations: 20 for the first month, 10 afterwards\nRecommended minimum withdraw amount: 0.01 Qtum\nP2P Network Port: 3888 (port forwarding is not required or recommended, but the wallet must be able to access other external nodes through this port to download the blockchain)\n\n"},"Guidance-of-Qtum-Deployment-and-RPC-Settings.html":{"url":"Guidance-of-Qtum-Deployment-and-RPC-Settings.html","title":"Guidance of Qtum Deployment and RPC Settings","keywords":"","body":"How to deploy a Qtum node\nThis guidance includes how to deploy, run and make RPC calls.\nSuppose the readers are able to use Linux,Mac or Windows command line. If you are not familiar with command line, or just interested in using GUI wallet, please refer to another document about Qtum Wallet Tutorial.\nGet Qtum Node\nThere are at least 4 ways to get a Qtum node, you can choose any way：\n1. Download the binaries\nIf you do not care much about Qtum's source code, the easiest way to abtain Qtum node is to download the latest binaries on the Qtum release page. Currently it supports Linux, Window, OSX. It is highly recommanded to download the latest version. In this guidance, we will use v0.14.13 version as an example。\n（Note: the version number you see might be different, here is v0.14.13, but other key words except for version are the same.）\n\nFor Mac user：qtum-0.14.13-osx64.tar.gz\nFor Linux users： qtum-0.14.13-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz(32bit) or qtum-0.14.13-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz(64bit)\nFor Windows users：qtum-0.14.13-win32.zip(32bit) or qtum-0.14.13-win64.zip（64bit）\nFor Raspberry Pi：qtum-0.14.13-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\n\nDecompress after downloading, then you will get qtumd and qtum-cli under the path /bin.\n2. apt install for Linux users\nPlease refer to https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Setting-up-QTUM-Ubuntu,-Debian-and-Mint-repository，Current support Ubuntu，Debian and Mint。\nRaspberry Pi users can also use apt，please refer to https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Installing-Qtum-on-Raspberry-Pi。\nAfter installation, you should be able to run qtumd and qtum-clidirectly in the terminal。\n3. Compiler from source code\nIf you want to compile latest Qtum from source code, please pull the latest source from github : https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum。\nThe instruction for compilation : https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/README.md。Currently we recommand to compile on Linux or OSX, while other platforms might need more configuration.\nAfter compilation, you also get qtumd and qtum-cli under the path /src/\n4. Get Qtum node docker image\nSuppose user has docker environment installed correctly. (what is docker?)\nThe Qtum official docker image on docker hub is qtum/qtum, you can pull it by docker command ：\ndocker pull qtum/qtum:latest\nAll the four ways above cand get Qtum nodes. There are two important binaries which are related to deployment and RPC calls:\n\nqtumd：Qtum core program, i.e. Qtum fullnode program.\nqtum-cli：Qtum command line interface，interact with qtumd, achieve RPC calls.\n\nDeploy Qtum node\nFor the instruction for Qtum docker images, please refer to \"How to launch Qtum with docker\".\nOther normal deployment methods are almost the same, here we take Ubuntu as an example. The commands in Mac and windows are exactly the same.\nRun Qtum fullnode with ./qtumd：\n./qtumd -daemon\nThis with launch a qtumd daemon with the option -daemon. If user are interested in the event logs about smart contract, please add one more option -logevents. \n More options can be found：\n./qtumd -help\nTo stop running：\n./qtum-cli stop\nThe default data path for different platforms:\n\nLinux：~/.qtum/\nMac OSX：~/Library/Application Support/Qtum\nWindows:%APPDATA%\\Qtum\n\nYou can also use -datadir to set your own data path。\nQtum node will sync all the historical block data for first launch, and saves to datadir. It might take some time. Then diagnostics for the node can be found under the data path ~/.qtum/debug.log。\nLocal RPC call\nWhen the qtum node is running, we can use qtum command line interface qtum-cli to interact with qtumd, and make local RPC calls.\ne.g.：\noldclock@raven:~/qtum-0.14.3/bin$ ./qtum-cli getinfo\n{\n  \"version\": 140300,\n  \"protocolversion\": 70016,\n  \"walletversion\": 130000,\n  \"balance\": 0.00000000,\n  \"stake\": 0.00000000,\n  \"blocks\": 12126,\n  \"timeoffset\": 0,\n  \"connections\": 8,\n  \"proxy\": \"\",\n  \"difficulty\": {\n    \"proof-of-work\": 1.52587890625e-05,\n    \"proof-of-stake\": 886731.5868738915\n  },\n  \"testnet\": false,\n  \"moneysupply\": 100028504,\n  \"keypoololdest\": 1505186997,\n  \"keypoolsize\": 100,\n  \"paytxfee\": 0.00000000,\n  \"relayfee\": 0.00400000,\n  \"errors\": \"\"\n}\nTo get all RPC command list:\n./qtum-cli help\nTo get help for specific RPC command, use ./qtum-cli help ，e.g.：\n./qtum-cli help getinfo\nJsonRPC settings\nYou can get the jsonrpc example by using (here we use getinfo as an example): ./qtum-cli help getinfo\nExamples:\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getinfo\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:3889/\nThe example shows detailed format for jsonrpc content. However, it can only be called after setting rpcuser and rpcpassword. There are two ways to set the parameters, you can choose either.\nMethod 1：Create config file ~/.qtum/qtum.conf，which should include:\nrpcuser=test  #rpc user name, (necessary)\nrpcpassword=test1234  #rpc password, (necessary)\n# By default, only local jsonrpc is allowed\n# Remote connection is allowed only when setting rpcallowip as following:\n# both ipv4 and ipv6 can be set, e.g.:\n#rpcallowip=192.168.77.51/255.255.255.0\n#rpcallowip=1.2.3.4/24\n#rpcallowip=2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8a2e:370:7334/96\nFor more config settings, please refer to ：qtum.conf example\nAfter creating the config file, please restart the node to finish settings.\nMethod 2：Restart Qtum node with following options:\n./qtumd -daemon -rpcuser=test -rpcpassword=test1234 -rpcallowip=192.168.77.51/255.255.255.0\nThe meaning of options rpcuser, rpcpassword and rpcallowip are all the same with the config file above. \nRPC call example\nYou can make remote RPC calls after the settings above. Here is an example: Suppose the qtum node is running on an Ubuntu machine, whose ip is 192.168.77.188, default port=3889. Now we try to make jsonrpc call in a remote macbook:\nzhongwenbins-MacBook-Pro:~ zhongwenbin$ curl --user test:test1234 --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getinfo\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://192.168.77.188:3889/\n{\"result\":{\"version\":140300,\"protocolversion\":70016,\"walletversion\":130000,\"balance\":0.00000000,\"stake\":0.00000000,\"blocks\":12197,\"timeoffset\":0,\"connections\":8,\"proxy\":\"\",\"difficulty\":{\"proof-of-work\":1.52587890625e-05,\"proof-of-stake\":650787.7561123729},\"testnet\":false,\"moneysupply\":100028788,\"keypoololdest\":1505186997,\"keypoolsize\":100,\"paytxfee\":0.00000000,\"relayfee\":0.00400000,\"errors\":\"\"},\"error\":null,\"id\":\"curltest\"}\nThe result is identical with local call.\nYou can also use tools like postman to get the same result：\n\nNginx settings（optional）\nAs the example above, you might find that it is quite complicated to make remote  jsonrpc, since you must include rpcuser, rpcpassword, as well as port in the command. If you don't want users to provide these parameters, we recommand using Nginx. The benefits for Nginx is not only about simplification, but also a good way to hide rpcuser, rpcpassword and port number. And you can filter some RPCs for security. Here we suppose the reader have installed Nginx and have basic knowledges about how to use it.\nexample:\n\nQtum node is running on 192.168.77.188,\napi proxy ip 192.168.77.51, with Nginx installed\n\nInstructions：\n1.Set the qtum.conf of qtum node, remember to add the proxy ip to rpcallowip e.g.：\nrpcuser=test\nrpcpassword=test1234\nrpcallowip=192.168.77.51/255.255.255.0\n2.Setup Nginx ：\n    server {\n        listen       80;\n        server_name  localhost;\n\n        location / {\n            proxy_pass http://192.168.77.188:3889;  #to port 3889\n            proxy_set_header Authorization \"Basic dGVzdDp0ZXN0MTIzNA==\";  # its the base64 encode of test:test1234\n        }\n    }\n3.Then you can make remote rpc call through proxy, without rpcuser or rpcpassword. e.g.：\nzhongwenbins-MacBook-Pro:~ zhongwenbin$ curl  --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getinfo\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://192.168.77.51/\n{\"result\":{\"version\":140300,\"protocolversion\":70016,\"walletversion\":130000,\"balance\":0.00000000,\"stake\":0.00000000,\"blocks\":12250,\"timeoffset\":0,\"connections\":8,\"proxy\":\"\",\"difficulty\":{\"proof-of-work\":1.52587890625e-05,\"proof-of-stake\":651324.7815933984},\"testnet\":false,\"moneysupply\":100029000,\"keypoololdest\":1505186997,\"keypoolsize\":100,\"paytxfee\":0.00000000,\"relayfee\":0.00400000,\"errors\":\"\"},\"error\":null,\"id\":\"curltest\"}\nThis is only a simple example. You might have different settings or tools instead.\nUseful commands and documents\nIf you have any questions during node deployment and RPC calls, here are some useful documents to refer to:\n\nFor source code compilation issues： https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/README.md。\nCommand to check all qtumd options：./qtumd -help\nCommand to get all RPC list： ./qtum-cli help\nGet RPC help（like getinfo）： ./qtum-cli help getinfo\nqtum.conf file example：qtum.conf\n\n"},"Launch-Qtum-with-Docker.html":{"url":"Launch-Qtum-with-Docker.html","title":"Launch Qtum With Docker","keywords":"","body":"How to run Qtum node with docker\nQuick start\nThis tutorial use Linux Ubuntu as example, OSX and windows platform are almost the same.\nSuppose the reader has basic command line knowledge, and also have docker correctly installed and configured.

It can take some minutes before it's fully synced.\nEncrypting wallet\nWe can encrypt the wallet at any time, it's better to do it before we go any further.\nTo do this, type the following on the command line:\nqtum-cli encryptwallet yourpassword\nThis will encrypt the wallet which in turn closes the daemon, you'll see the following message:\nwallet encrypted; Qtum server stopping, restart to run with encrypted wallet. The keypool has been flushed and a new HD seed was generated (if you are using HD). You need to make a new backup.\n\nqtum-cli getaccountaddress \"\" -> Right after launching the daemon, you can obtain your wallet address by typing this.\nYou can send Qtum coins to the address we just obtained from the daemon, please remember that those transactions require at least 500+ confirmations before they become mature enough for staking.\nStaking\nNow that we've waited until we have at least 501 confirmations on our received transaction, we are elligible for staking, however, if our wallet is encrypted (which we did for security reasons) we won't be able to stake, let's open our wallet for staking using the command line!.\nqtum-cli walletpassphrase password 999999999 true\nThe above command will unlock the walet for staking only for 31.6 Years! that should be enough for now. Please note, this will not unlock your backup, only the wallet that's running right now.\nNow that we've unlocked our wallet, we need to wait until we have more than 501 confirmations to be elligible for staking, if we already do, it's a matter of time which will vary depending on the network weight vs your wallet's weight.\nChecking Balance\nTo check your balance, type qtum-cli getinfo this will show general information, including your available balance and balance in staking\nCheck transactions\nTo check your transactions (incoming and outgoing) type qtum-cli listtransactions\nCheck staking info\nTo check Qtum's staking information, type qtum-cli getstakinginfo\nStaking tips\nStaking really depends on network weight vs your wallet’s weight which is based on the amount of coins you have, higher weight increases your chances of staking a block.\nIf you have a large amount of coins, it’s a good idea to split those up in separate transactions, for instance, if you have 10.000 QTUM, it’s better to send 10 transactions of 1000 QTUM each to your wallet, each one generates a UTXO input which will take part in staking. This optimizes the staking process and works much better than just one large 10.000 QTUM input.\nIf you want to split your coins into different addresses inside your VPS wallet, type the following to obtain new addresses inside your wallet: qtum-cli getnewaddress\nEach time you type this, you’ll get a new address, QTUM can generate any amount of addresses you want, but please keep in mind, if you do go over 100 new address, you might want to make a new backup of your wallet.\nWallet Backup\nBacking up your wallet from a Linux VPS is different from a desktop but not too complicated, there's several ways to do this, and here are some steps which should work on all major desktop OS.\nFirst, we'll download Filezilla, which is an easy to use and secure FTP/SFTP server\nhttps://filezilla-project.org\n\nInstalling is just like any other windows app.\n\nWhen the installer finishes, we launch Filezilla and are greeted with this screen, let's proceed and add our previously created ssh-key\nWe go into Edit -> Settings -> SFTP. This will give us the following screen in which we will be able to import our SSH key.\n\nPlease note that Filezilla only accepts the private key which is created when the ssh-key was generated.\n Here we've already added the ssh key, now we can log into our server\n\nwe enter our VPS ip address + username (root in this case),  leave a blank password because we're using ssh-key to login \nJust press ok when prompted, and you'll be able to log in. \n\nHere we can see the /root/ folder of our VPS, this is where our wallet runs and has the wallet stored in /root/.qtum we can go ahead and double click the folder which will show us the following: \nNow all we need to do is scroll down to wallet.dat, right click and select download from the list. This will download the wallet.dat file to our computer, we've successfully backed up our Qtum wallet!.\nUpdating wallet\nIf you installed Qtum the old way (without using the repository)\nWe highly recommend using the repository from now on, however, if you still want to compile the wallet yourself, here’s how to upgrade:\n(Backup your wallet.dat first)\ncd ~/qtum/\ngit pull\n./configure\nmake\nqtum-cli stop\nmake install\nqtumd -daemon\nWhat happened there?\n\nWe updated the sources from the original build folder (if you don’t have it anymore, you need to pull the entire repo as was shown in the beginning of this tutorial).\nWe configured and built the new Qtum daemon\nWe stopped the old daemon\nWe installed the new daemon\nWe executed the new daemon\n\nIf you installed Qtum using the repo\nIf you used the repository to install your Qtum wallet, it’s very easy to upgrade to a new version, all you have to do is the following:\napt update && apt upgrade\nThis will update the apt sources on your Linux box and install the latest packages, Qtum included. If you only want to upgrade Qtum:\napt update && apt install —only-upgrade qtum\n"},"Qtum-on-Raspberry-Pi/":{"url":"Qtum-on-Raspberry-Pi/","title":"Stake With Raspberry Pi","keywords":"","body":"Qtum on Raspberry Pi\nJust like we did on Debian, we need to download and install Qtum's public key\nwget -qO - http://repo.qtum.info/apt/public.key | sudo apt-key add -\nThis downloads and installs the Qtum public key\nAdding repository to your APT sources.\nsudo su - Sudo to root first\necho \"deb http://repo.qtum.info/apt/raspbian/ jessie main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list\nor\necho \"deb http://repo.qtum.info/apt/raspbian/ stretch main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list\nThis will add the repository to your APT sources file.\nRefreshing APT sources and installing Qtum\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install qtum\nBy doing this, we'll update our sources and install Qtum on our raspberry Box, which can act now as a staking server/node.\nChanging default password\nThis option is recommended for security reasons, the default password on the pi is well known, it's highly recommended to change it upon first login.\nTo change just type: passwd\nThe prompt will ask you to write and repeat the new password to confirm.\nProtecting access with a basic firewall\nWell, our raspberry is only for staking, there's no need to have all those ports open, let's close everything we don't need and only allow access to necesary services.\nFirst, let's install UFW (uncomplicated firewall) which is an easy-to-use interface for iptables\nsudo apt install ufw\nOnce this is installed, we proceed with access permissions, we will define which ports will be accessible. Let's check first what's open:\nsudo ufw status This should show something like this: \nStatus: active\nTo               Action      From\n--               ------      ----\n22               ALLOW       Anywhere\nOk so it's time to start closing down access, type the following:\nsudo ufw default deny incoming\nsudo ufw allow 3888/tcp\nsudo ufw allow 3889/tcp\nHere we've defined the basics, closing down everything except port 3888 and 3889 which are used by Qtum to function.\nIf you're using SSH, it's recommended to only allow access from local network.\nsudo ufw allow from 196.168.0.0/24 to any port 22\nLaunching Qtum daemon\nAll we need to do to launch the Qtum daemon is type:\nqtumd -daemon\nAs soon as you type this, the wallet will create the wallet.dat file among other files (if they’re not already there).

If you alreadby backed up before encrypting, you  need to make a new backup. \nqtum-cli getaccountaddress \"\" -> Right after launching the daemon, you can obtain your wallet address by typing this.\nYou can send Qtum coins to the address we just obtained from the daemon, please remember that those transactions require at least 500+ confirmations before they become mature enough for staking.\nStaking\nNow that we've waited until we have at least 501 confirmations on our received transaction, we are elligible for staking, however, if our wallet is encrypted (which we did for security reasons) we won't be able to stake, let's open our wallet for staking using the command line!.\nqtum-cli walletpassphrase password 999999999 true\nThe above command will unlock the walet for 31.6 Years! that should be enough for now. Please note, this will not unlock your backup, only the wallet that's running right now.\nNow that we've unlocked our wallet, we need to wait until we have more than 501 confirmations to be elligible for staking, if we already do, it's a matter of time which will vary depending on the network weight vs your wallet's weight.\nChecking Balance\nTo check your balance, type qtum-cli getinfo this will show general information, including your available balance and balance in staking\nCheck transactions\nTo check your transactions (incoming and outgoing) type qtum-cli listtransactions\nCheck staking info\nTo check Qtum's staking information, type qtum-cli getstakinginfo\nStaking tips\nStaking really depends on network weight vs your wallet’s weight which is based on the amount of coins you have, higher weight increases your chances of staking a block.\nIf you have a large amount of coins, it’s a good idea to split those up in separate transactions, for instance, if you have 10.000 QTUM, it’s better to send 10 transactions of 1000 QTUM each to your wallet, each one generates a UTXO input which will take part in staking. This optimizes the staking process and works much better than just one large 10.000 QTUM input.\nIf you want to split your coins into different addresses inside your VPS wallet, type the following to obtain new addresses inside your wallet: qtum-cli getnewaddress Each time you type this, you’ll get a new address, QTUM can generate any amount of addresses you want, but please keep in mind, if you do go over 100 new address, you might want to make a new backup of your wallet.\nUpdating wallet\nWe’re always launching new updates, sometimes it’s to add new features or fix bugs.

The mining process in PoS system is called staking. The block producer will get 4QTUM, as well as the transaction fees and gases as block reward. So the real reward is usually more than 4QTUM in total.\nBasic requirements for staking：\n\nRun a Qtum fullnode, and keep online (Since Qtum is using PoS, we don't need any mining machine, just PC or even Raspberry Pi can run a fullnode);\nHave some QTUM in the wallet (fullnode)（Any amount of QTUM can be used for staking, more QTUM means higher possibility to stake).\n\nIf you have no QTUM yet, please get some from market before you doing following staking settings.\nCurrently, Qtum Core wallet is the only wallet that support Qtum PoS staking. Note that other wallets like mobile wallet and Qtum Electrum are not able to stake for the time being.\nTwo ways to stake:\n\nMethod 1：Staking with qtumd, using command line, suitable for Linux/OSX/Windows/Raspberry Pi users who are familiar with command line tools.\nMethod 2：Staking with qtum-qt wallet, with GUI, suitable for common users.\n\nEither way works in the same way for staking, so you can choose either method you like.\nMethod 1：Staking with qtumd (command line)\n1. Run qtumd\nTo run qtumd, please refer to\"How to deploy Qtum node\".\nFollow the guidance to run qtumd:\n./qtumd -daemon\nStaking is default on for qtumd, so no need for other options if you only want to stake. \n2. Send some QTUM to your wallet\nFirst you can generate a new address with：\n./qtum-cli getnewaddress\nThis will generate a new address with Prefix 'Q'. You can send some QTUM to this new generated address for staking. You can generate as many addresses as you like, and send arbitrary QTUM as you like for staking.\nNote：The coin should wait for 500 blocks before being able to stake, i.e. about 17 hours to MATURE.. \nAfter the Qtum node syncing to the latest block, you can check current balance with ./qtum-cli getbalance or get utxo list with./qtum-cli listunspent。（what is UTXO?）。\nPlease do following steps after your coin is mature.\n3. Check staking info\nCheck current staking info with：\n./qtum-cli getstakinginfo\nYou might get the result like this：\n{\n  \"enabled\": true,\n  \"staking\": true,\n  \"errors\": \"\",\n  \"currentblocksize\": 1000,\n  \"currentblocktx\": 0,\n  \"pooledtx\": 5,\n  \"difficulty\": 5683612.564280176,\n  \"search-interval\": 46,\n  \"weight\": 53206430,\n  \"netstakeweight\": 2278172497819029,\n  \"expectedtime\": 5480654870\n}\nenabled means if your wallet have enabled staking, it should be true by default. staking means if your wallet is currently staking (mining). weight stands for the amount of QTUM that is staking right now, with unit 10^-8QTUM, here in the example, we have 0.532QTUM staking. expectedtime stands for the expected time that you will get a reward, the unit is second.\n4. How to stake if the wallet is encrypted？\nIf your wallet is not encrypted, you can skip this section. However, for security, we recommand you encrypt your wallet. (How to encrypt?)\nQtum wallet can be encrypted with encryptwallet. However, staking will be stopped when it is encrypted. For example, ./qtum-cli getstakinginfo for a encrypted wallet：\n{\n  \"enabled\": true,\n  \"staking\": false,\n  \"errors\": \"\",\n  \"currentblocksize\": 1000,\n  \"currentblocktx\": 0,\n  \"pooledtx\": 94,\n  \"difficulty\": 5788429.670171153,\n  \"search-interval\": 0,\n  \"weight\": 53206430,\n  \"netstakeweight\": 2438496688951881,\n  \"expectedtime\": 0\n}\nSee staking turns to false, which means wallet is not staking.\nYou can use walletpassphrase to unlock wallet for staking：\n./qtum-cli walletpassphrase \"\" 99999999 true\nThe meaning of the arguments can be found in the documents \"How to encrypt?\".\nAfter unlocking, you can double check getstakinginfo, it should look the same with previous unlocked result, staking become true.\nMethod 2: Staking with qtum-qt wallet (official PC wallet)\nHow to use Qtum-qt tutorial? please refer to Qtum qt wallet tutorial. Current supported platform: Mac/Linux/Windows.\n1. Open Qtum qt wallet\nLaunch the wallet.\n2. 转入QTUM量子币\nIf you already have some QTUM in your wallet, you might skip this step.\nIf not, please send some QTUM to your wallet first. (How to receive?).\nNote：The coin should wait for 500 blocks before being able to stake, i.e. about 17 hours to MATURE.. \n3. Check staking status\nThe flash sign at the bottom of wallet shows staking info :\nSolid black flash means it is staking now. For more information, you can put your mouse on the flash, e.g.:\n\n\nStaking: if it is staking；\nYour weight is: How many QTUM are able to used for staking, unit is QTUM;\nNetwork weight is: How many QTUM are staking in the network, unit is QTUM；\nExpected time: expected time to get reward, unit is Day.\n\nHollow flash measn it is not staking\nPossible reasons for not staking：\n\n1.There is no coins of no mature coins (more than 500 confirmations(blocks)) -- Solution: send some QTUM to the wallet and wait for 500 blocks (about 17 hours);\n\n\n\n2.Wallet is locked/encrypted -- Solution: unlock the wallet for staking. (How to unlock?)\n\n\nNo flash sign means staking is disabled\n\n3.Staking is disabled -- Solution: enable staking in the qtum.conf (-staking=true)(How to set qtum.conf？)\n\n\nAbout block reward\nThe block producer will get more than 4QTUM rewards, something to keep in mind:\n\nThe reward come from a new transaction, you can check balance to see if you get the reward.\nOnce succesfully stake, you will get 0.4QTUM reward immediately.\nOther 3.6QTUM will be sent to you after 500 blocks (about 17hours), in continuous 9 blocks, within each block you will get 0.4QTUM,, so in total it will be 4QTUM.\nThe staked coins (UTXO) will be locked for 500 blocks, during this period, it cannot be spent nor be used to stake. \n\nHow to disable staking?\nStaking is by default enabled for Qtum wallet. If you need to disable staking for some reason (for example exchanges are always recommanded to disable staking), you might following anyone of the 3 ways below:\n1 Add -staking=false when running Qtum node：\n./qtumd -staking=false -daemon\nFor qt wallet, it is like：\n./qtum-qt -staking=false\n2 Add config staking=false in qtum.conf;(How to set qtum.conf？)\n3 Encrypt wallet, since encrypted wallet will automatically stop staking.(How to unlock?)\n"},"Technical-White-Paper-for-QtumX/":{"url":"Technical-White-Paper-for-QtumX/","title":"QtumX Technical White Paper","keywords":"","body":"Technical White Paper for QtumX\nBackground\nThe Qtum Enterprise version, named QtumX, aims to develop a consortium blockchain, in which the consensus process is executed by a small group of authorized nodes, whereas the right to read and create transactions is still public.\nThis version will be built on the basis of the Qtum framework, which has proved to be a successful public blockchain. New modules are introduced to meet the following enterprise requirements:\n\nHigh TPS (Transactions Per Second) and short confirmation time. \nCustomizable settings for using in various usage scenarios.\n\nConsensus Algorithm\nConsortium Blockchain and Proof of Authority\nBlockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Qtum are called public blockchains. They have no access restriction. Anyone can send transactions to them as well as participate in the block creation process. In these cases, many consensus algorithms are developed, such as PoW (Proof of Work) and PoS (Proof of Stake), allowing a large number of users to reach a consensus about who can mine new blocks. These blockchains are generally considered to be fully decentralized.\nA consortium blockchain is often said to be partially decentralized, where the consensus process is executed by a small group of authorized nodes. For example, a consortium of three game companies plan to launch a blockchain with cryptocurrencies which can be spent in their games. Each of them runs a node to verify transactions and mine blocks. Game players, however, only have access to reading blocks and sending transactions. In this situation, just the three authorized nodes need to reach a consensus on block producing.\n\nFor consortium blockchains, the consensus algorithm is usually called PoA (Proof of Authority). Instead of solving a difficult mathematical problem in PoW or holding a large amount of cryptocurrencies in PoS, in PoA, a list of authorized block miners is used to determine which nodes are allowed to create new blocks. The chain has to be signed by the majority of miners, then it becomes a permanent record. It is more efficient and secure since the miners are fewer and more reliable.\nA BFT type Consensus Algorithm\nHere we introduce a PoA consensus algorithm which will be available in the Qtum Enterprise version. It is a BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) type algorithm and is always addressed as the signed-message solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem [1]. Each block has to be signed by its miner and the system stops producing new blocks only when half or more than half of the authorized nodes are down. We illustrate the entire algorithm here first and describe it in detail in the following paragraphs.\n\nTo help explain this algorithm we assume there are 5 authorized block miners, A, B, C, D, E. Their public keys are stored in an ordered list. This list is initialized at the very beginning of the blockchain and can be updated later by a smart contract. So we suppose that, at block height h1, the current_authorized_miner_list is [pubkey_A, pubkey_B, pubkey_C, pubkey_D, pubkey_E]\n. Then these 5 block miners will take turns producing a new block, from height h1 to h2, like the illustration below.\n\nWhen producing a new block, the miner has to use the secp256k1_ecdsa_sign_recoverable function to sign the block and then add the output signature to the block. By this way, other nodes can recover the miner's public key from the signature by using the function secp256k1_ecdsa_recover, and then verify its authority through the current_authorized_miner_list.\nThe chain which is signed by the majority of authorized miners can be regarded as a permanent record. For example, in the illustration above, the blockchain from the genesis to the height of h3 is permanent, since it has been verified and signed by its following block miners D, E and A. If anyone tries to create a fork at a height lower than h3, it will never be followed by the majority of authorized miners.\nTherefore, at least n/2+1 miners are needed to keep the algorithm working, where n is the total number of authorized block miners and n/2 is a integer division. In our example n=5, so at least 3 nodes are need. That is, nodes A, B, C can continue to mine new blocks when D, E are shutdown. The output blockchain, which would be like ABCABC, is valid. This consensus algorithm can be simply defined as follows:\n\nOne miner can mine the next block when:\n\nIt is currently authorized.\nRecent n/2 blocks are not mined by it. \n\n\nBy this definition, we are able to obtain the miners which are actually allowed to mine the next block. It simply requires removing miners of the recent n/2 blocks from the current_authorized_miner_list. For example, at the height h2, the next_block_miner_list can be calculated as.\n\nAlthough B, C, D all can mine the next block, a priority order should be specified for them, so as to avoid their competition for the next block and ensure the blockchain would be verified by as many miners as possible. Therefore, we define the next_block_miner_list as an ordered list, where the miner next to the current block miner in current_authorized_miner_list is supposed to be at the first place, and so on. In our example, the order of B, C, E is shown in the illustration above.\nWhen the priority order is determined, the block_time for each miner is calculated afterwards. The miner with a higher order in the next_block_miner_list is assigned an earlier block_time. Each miner uses the assigned block_time to create a new block and keeps waiting until the block_time. If no block is received during the waiting, the miner will then broadcast its block. The calculation of block_time is illustrated as:\n\nIn this way, if one node fails to mine a block, the next miner will take place after timeout later. Here is an example. Node B is down when producing the block at height h2+1. Then node C, which is next to B in next_block_miner_list, will broadcast its block interval+timeout after parent_block_time.\n\nDGP for Authorities Storage and Update\nDGP (Decentralized Governance Protocol) [2] is a technology used in Qtum, which allows blockchain parameters to be modified through a specially designed smart contract on the blockchain, without any disruption to the ecosystem like soft or hard forks.\nThe way the DGP works is relatively straightforward. First, a governing party for the DGP makes a proposal to change a parameter. Afterward, all the governing parties for the DGP can vote on the proposal, and if it receives enough approval votes, then the parameter change proposal becomes active. The proposal data is then placed in a standardized format and a particular storage space so that the blockchain software can easily access it without needing to execute the DGP contract directly.\nObviously, the DGP is also a suitable method for the storage and update of the authorized block miners in PoA. The miners, actually a list of public keys, can be initialized by a config file and then updated by the DGP. But here we should make a little modification to the DGP so that the update process can be more secure.\n\nThe new miner list activated by the DGP should take effect a few blocks later, when the activation is verified and signed by n/2+1 miners of the previous list. \n\nHere, n is the length of the previous list and n/2 represents a integer division. This mechanism ensures that the update process takes effect when it becomes a permanent record in the blockchain. Otherwise, if the update process can be denied by another fork, it is possible for those previous miners to work on that fork and even cause a hard fork afterwards.\nBlock Reward\nDifferent from the coinstake in PoS, block miners of PoA are rewarded in the coinbase for simplicity. The contract refund, which is generated by the contract execution in Qtum, should be added to the coinbase as well. Therefore, the coinbase in PoA contains one or more outputs. The first one is paid to the block miner and its amount equals to the sum of transaction fees and block subsidy, while others are contract refund outputs.\nCustomizable Settings\nWe will try to make most parameters configurable in the Enterprise version. So that the system can be easily applied to various usage scenarios. Some customizable settings are listed as follows:\n\nThe genesis block: block_time, coinbase.\nNetwork parameters: pchMessageStart, seeds.\nParameters for the PoA consensus algorithm: interval, timeout.\nBlock reward parameters: initial value, nSubsidyHalvingInterval\n\nApplications\n\nThe best way to describe the value of QtumX is to take a look at its applications. Here we will show 3 usage scenarios of QtumX. More applications need to be discovered in the future when we actually use it.\nToken-based Applications\nAs a blockchain system, one basic application is the token. With QtumX, you can easily build a system for the storage and exchange of tokens. Here the term \"token\" can be:\n\nGold coins in internet games\nGift card distributed by supermarkets\nAir miles got from airlines\n\nThese usage scenarios demand several features, like high TPS, fast confirmation and thin client. All these features are supported in QtumX.\nSmart-contract-based Applications\nSmart contract based applications are also worth expecting. You can transform written contracts or rules into smart contracts of QtumX. By this way, the contract will be transparent, unmodifiable and easy to verify. Using a consortium blockchain to deploy smart contracts has several advantages. The most important one is that the developer only need to run some miner nodes for the blockchain, rather than consume public blockchain tokens which are really expensive.\nHere are some smart contract based applications:\n\nPrediction markets\nInsurance, like car insurance and property insurance\nSales and lease of real estate\nGames\n\nDigital Identity\nDigital identity means recording some important information in blockchain so that it can be verified and tracked by the public. Using a consortium blockchain to do this can also save money when compared to a public blockchain. Usage scenarios can be:\n\nSupply chain management: track products from the producer to the retailer\nEducation records: record education experience or online courses experience\nLuxury: record information of luxury for public verification\n\nFuture Work\nThe QtumX project aims to build a business solution, helping enterprises, organizations and schools to apply the blockchain technology to their areas. So it will be more than a consortium blockchain proposed in this paper. More information about QtumX will be published after we applied the patents related.\nReferences\n[1] Driscoll, Kevin; Hall, Brendan; Sivencrona, Håkan; Zumsteg, Phil. \"Byzantine Fault Tolerance, from Theory to Reality\". \n[2] qtum.org. \"Qtum's Decentralized Governance Protocol\". \n"},"One-Click-Launch-Chain/":{"url":"One-Click-Launch-Chain/","title":"QtumX One-Click-Launch-Chain","keywords":"","body":"QtumX One-Click-Launch-Chain\n\nQtumX One-Click-Launch-Chain\nDownload\nSign up and Sign in\nBuild Private Chain\nGenerate Configuration\nStart Private Chain\nConnect Private Chain\n\n\nSeed Node\nBuild Consortium Chain\nConfiguration\nStart\n\n\nOnline Governance\nAbout DGP\nModify Miners List\nModify System Parameters\n\n\n\nDownload\nDownload the latest installation package from Github and install it to any directory.\nSign up and Sign in\n\nRun qtumd or qtum-qt to start the main chain of Qtum.\nOpen the Help - Debug window - Console of QT wallet or execute the RPC command by qtum-cli.\nExecute the getnewaddress command, generate a new address as an account and record it.\nExecute the dumpprivkey command, get the private key of the new address, and record it.\nOpen the QtumX[home page] (https://qtumx.net/), click LOGIN to enter the login page.\nExecute the signmessage command, use the generated address to sign the message in the login page, and fill in the login page with the result of signature.\nClick LOGIN to complete the login.\n\n\n\nBuild Private Chain\nIn order to make it easier to understand, we will first introduce how to build own private chain.\nGenerate Configuration\nClick LAUNCH A NEW CHAIN，enter the page of release new chain.After filling in all the information of the new chain,click SUBMIT to release the new chain.The meaning of each field is as follows.\n\nChain id:the name of the chain,only support lowercase letters and numbers,unique.Such as mychain123.\nToken name:the name of the token,only support capital letters and numbers,unique.Such as BTC、QTX.\nDescription:the description of the chain,to introduce the chain,also used to generate genesis block.Such as:my first blockchain.\nMessage Header:Network head packet,used to distinguish different chains in network transmission.4 byte length,sixteen decimal representation,8 0-9a-f characters,such as:1234fedc.\nAlgorithm:Consensus algorithm.Only PoA consensus is supported now,more choices will be provided in the future.Want to know more about PoA,referenceQtumX technical white paper.\nMiner list:the list of PoA miners,one or more address,separated by commas.When we build the first private chain,use the default account.\nBlock interval、Timeout:See the technical white paper, you can use the default value directly.\nDefault port:The default port address.\nDns seed、Ip seed:The default connection seed node in the network when new node join.Because it is a private chain,left empty here.\nInit Reward:Initial rewards for each block.\nHalving interval:The reward will be half after several blocks.\nHalving times:Times of half.\n\nStart Private Chain\nWe create a chain named X（link),start the chain by the following steps.\n\nUse qtumd -chain=x or After the configuration and restart in qtum-qt as shown in the following figure,start the chain named X.\n\nExecute getpoaminerlist,see the list of miners.\nExecute importprivkey,import the miner's private key.\nExecute setpoaminer,use miner's account to mine.It needs to run this command to mine after node restarts.\n\nWe can see that the number of block is increasing from the QT purse or execute getblockchaininfo command.\n\nNew chain startup success,try trading or intelligent contracts！\n\nConnect Private Chain\nAssuming that we have started the private chain X on the machine A and mine,then we need to start the node on the machine B and access the private chain.\n\nExecute qtumd -chain=x or do configuration to start node of X in qtum-qt on machine B.\nExecute addnode \"ip_A\" add,connect the node on machine A.\nAfter connecting, we can view the node situation through the getpeerinfo command.\nTry to trade with each other between the two nodes.\n\n\nSeed Node\nThe new node of the block chain can quickly find the network by connecting the seed node (seed) at the time of startup,save the steps of addnode at the above text.The seed node can be a IP or a domain name,and there are nodes running on the corresponding servers.
