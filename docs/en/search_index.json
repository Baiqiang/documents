You can select any desired option, we went with a basic 1CPU/512MB ram VPS.SSH KeysIt is recommended to use ssh-key to login instead of passwords, its far more secure and convenient.Creating ssh-keys is out of the scope of this tutorial, but here are some good references on how to do this:https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-do-i-generate-ssh-keyshttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/getting-started/ssh-keys/generating-an-ssh-key-manually/manually-generating-your-ssh-key-in-windows this one is for Windows users.After we've created our SSH key, we click on \"add new\"Here we can paste our SSH-key, enter a name for it and click on add ssh key.Logging in to your VPSOnce we have our credentials ready, we log in and see the following screen:Install through repository (Ubuntu 16.04 -> 17.10 and Linux Mint)This is the recommended method for most users as it’s easier, faster and more convenient.\n​Obtaining signing keyFirst, we need to obtain the Qtum signing key from the ubuntu keyserver, here's how:sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys BF5B197DThis will download and add the Qtum signing key to your linux install.Adding repository to your APT sources.``` sudo su - Sudo to root firstecho \"deb http://repo.qtum.info/apt/ubuntu/ xenial main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.listThis will add the repository to your APT sources file. NOTE: Please remember to change \"xenial\" for your Ubuntu version codename\n\nRefreshing APT sources and installing Qtum\n\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install qtumBy doing this, we'll update our sources and install Qtum on our ubuntu Box\n\nTo execute the daemon:\n\n``` qtumd -daemon```\n\n### Build on Ubuntu 16.04\n\n\nIt's always good to refresh installed libraries, for that we do apt update && apt upgrade and just press enter when prompted. This will update all installed packages while also installing any available security updates.\n\n\n\nOnce we finish the update, let's proceed to installing dependencies and cloning the qtum sources from Github.\nEnabling SWAPThis step is necessary as most VPS don't come with SWAP enabled and it'll cause low-ram compilation errors, here's how to create SWAP.dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=2048\n chmod 600 /swapfile\nmkswap /swapfile\nswapon /swapfile\necho \"/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0\" >> /etc/fstab\nThis creates a 2GB swap file which will allow you to build and run Qtum without issues.Compiling QtumThis is a quick start script for compiling Qtum on  Ubuntusudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libssl-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils git cmake libboost-all-dev\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-devIf you want to build the Qt GUI:sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compilergit clone https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum --recursive\ncd qtumNote autogen will prompt to install some more dependencies if needed./autogen.sh\n./configure\nmake -j2\nmake install\n```Compiling Qtum takes a while, it depends a lot on your VPS resources, it can take anywhere from 3 minutes to 20+ minutes.Once the process is finished, you'll have all qtum executables in /usr/local/bin/ you can check by typingls /usr/local/bin/Launching Qtum daemonqtumd -daemon  -> This launches the qtum daemon and the blockchain begins to synchronize right after launching. It can take some minutes before it's fully synced.Encrypting walletWe can encrypt the wallet at any time, it's better to do it before we go any further.To do this, type the following on the command line:qtum-cli encryptwallet yourpasswordThis will encrypt the wallet which in turn closes the daemon, you'll see the following message:wallet encrypted; Qtum server stopping, restart to run with encrypted wallet. The keypool has been flushed and a new HD seed was generated (if you are using HD). You need to make a new backup.qtum-cli getaccountaddress \"\" -> Right after launching the daemon, you can obtain your wallet address by typing this.You can send Qtum coins to the address we just obtained from the daemon, please remember that those transactions require at least 500+ confirmations before they become mature enough for staking.StakingNow that we've waited until we have at least 501 confirmations on our received transaction, we are elligible for staking, however, if our wallet is encrypted (which we did for security reasons) we won't be able to stake, let's open our wallet for staking using the command line!.qtum-cli walletpassphrase password 999999999 trueThe above command will unlock the walet for staking only for 31.6 Years! that should be enough for now. Please note, this will not unlock your backup, only the wallet that's running right now.Now that we've unlocked our wallet, we need to wait until we have more than 501 confirmations to be elligible for staking, if we already do, it's a matter of time which will vary depending on the network weight vs your wallet's weight.Checking BalanceTo check your balance, type qtum-cli getinfo this will show general information, including your available balance and balance in stakingCheck transactionsTo check your transactions (incoming and outgoing) type qtum-cli listtransactionsCheck staking infoTo check Qtum's staking information, type qtum-cli getstakinginfoStaking tipsStaking really depends on network weight vs your wallet’s weight which is based on the amount of coins you have, higher weight increases your chances of staking a block.If you have a large amount of coins, it’s a good idea to split those up in separate transactions, for instance, if you have 10.000 QTUM, it’s better to send 10 transactions of 1000 QTUM each to your wallet, each one generates a UTXO input which will take part in staking. This optimizes the staking process and works much better than just one large 10.000 QTUM input.If you want to split your coins into different addresses inside your VPS wallet, type the following to obtain new addresses inside your wallet: qtum-cli getnewaddress\nEach time you type this, you’ll get a new address, QTUM can generate any amount of addresses you want, but please keep in mind, if you do go over 100 new address, you might want to make a new backup of your wallet.Wallet BackupBacking up your wallet from a Linux VPS is different from a desktop but not too complicated, there's several ways to do this, and here are some steps which should work on all major desktop OS.First, we'll download Filezilla, which is an easy to use and secure FTP/SFTP serverhttps://filezilla-project.orgInstalling is just like any other windows app.When the installer finishes, we launch Filezilla and are greeted with this screen, let's proceed and add our previously created ssh-keyWe go into Edit -> Settings -> SFTP. This will give us the following screen in which we will be able to import our SSH key.Please note that Filezilla only accepts the private key which is created when the ssh-key was generated. Here we've already added the ssh key, now we can log into our serverwe enter our VPS ip address + username (root in this case),  leave a blank password because we're using ssh-key to login Just press ok when prompted, and you'll be able to log in. Here we can see the /root/ folder of our VPS, this is where our wallet runs and has the wallet stored in /root/.qtum we can go ahead and double click the folder which will show us the following: Now all we need to do is scroll down to wallet.dat, right click and select download from the list. This will download the wallet.dat file to our computer, we've successfully backed up our Qtum wallet!.Updating walletIf you installed Qtum the old way (without using the repository)We highly recommend using the repository from now on, however, if you still want to compile the wallet yourself, here’s how to upgrade:\n(Backup your wallet.dat first)\ncd ~/qtum/\ngit pull\n./configure\nmake\nqtum-cli stop\nmake install\nqtumd -daemonWhat happened there?We updated the sources from the original build folder (if you don’t have it anymore, you need to pull the entire repo as was shown in the beginning of this tutorial).\n\nWe configured and built the new Qtum daemon\n\nWe stopped the old daemon\n\nWe installed the new daemon\n\nWe executed the new daemon\n\nIf you installed Qtum using the repoIf you used the repository to install your Qtum wallet, it’s very easy to upgrade to a new version, all you have to do is the following:apt update && apt upgradeThis will update the apt sources on your Linux box and install the latest packages, Qtum included. If you only want to upgrade Qtum:apt update && apt install —only-upgrade qtum"},"Qtum-on-Raspberry-Pi/":{"url":"Qtum-on-Raspberry-Pi/","title":"Stake With Raspberry Pi","keywords":"","body":"Qtum on Raspberry PiJust like we did on Debian, we need to download and install Qtum's public keywget -qO - http://repo.qtum.info/apt/public.key | sudo apt-key add -This downloads and installs the Qtum public keyAdding repository to your APT sources.sudo su - Sudo to root firstecho \"deb http://repo.qtum.info/apt/raspbian/ jessie main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list\nor\necho \"deb http://repo.qtum.info/apt/raspbian/ stretch main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.listThis will add the repository to your APT sources file.Refreshing APT sources and installing Qtumsudo apt update && sudo apt install qtumBy doing this, we'll update our sources and install Qtum on our raspberry Box, which can act now as a staking server/node.Launching Qtum daemonAll we need to do to launch the Qtum daemon is type:\nqtumd -daemonAs soon as you type this, the wallet will create the wallet.dat file among other files (if they’re not already there). The wallet will run and begin syncing instantly from the other Blockchain nodes, this can take a few hours to complete so you can go ahead and have some coffee and let it synchronize.Encrypting walletWe can encrypt the wallet at any time, it's better to do it before we go any further.To do this, type the following on the command line:qtum-cli encryptwallet yourpasswordThis will encrypt the wallet which in turn closes the daemon, you'll see the following message:wallet encrypted; Qtum server stopping, restart to run with encrypted wallet. If you alreadby backed up before encrypting, you  need to make a new backup. qtum-cli getaccountaddress \"\" -> Right after launching the daemon, you can obtain your wallet address by typing this.You can send Qtum coins to the address we just obtained from the daemon, please remember that those transactions require at least 500+ confirmations before they become mature enough for staking.StakingNow that we've waited until we have at least 501 confirmations on our received transaction, we are elligible for staking, however, if our wallet is encrypted (which we did for security reasons) we won't be able to stake, let's open our wallet for staking using the command line!.qtum-cli walletpassphrase password 999999999 trueThe above command will unlock the walet for 31.6 Years! that should be enough for now.

In any case, updating is a breeze, all you have to do is type\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install —only-upgrade qtum"}}}
